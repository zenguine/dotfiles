Configuration files from my home directory put under version control.

Requirements for install:
Ruby and ruby-dev package installed

To install:
git clone http://github.com/phenguin/dotfiles .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./setup

The setup script does the following things:
1. Symlinks the appropriate configuration files in your home
directories to point to the files in this folder.  If these files
already exists it moves them to a backup directory called
"old_dotfiles".
2. Runs git submodule update and git submodule init to pull the latest
version of the vim plugins that I use.
3. Compiles an external library used for the command-T vim plugin.
